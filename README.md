# CSharpUni

Code written for QUT class CAB201 Programming Principles

All code outside of card_games was coded myself or supplied by the uni to expand from.

The project for card_games was done in a team of two, however I hadn't even heard of git at this point in my studies and as such my partner and I just split it into two and transfered the code manually, mostly via facebook (I know, it was genius).
As such, all code for single die pig and solitaire was handled 100% by myself and code for twenty-one and double-dice pig was handled by my partner, with some help from myself as I had completed my sections before he had decided to start. (Got to love Uni group work)

Programs were run via the visual studio solution files however I plan on compiling them properly relatively soon as to be viewed easier.
